### Graceful Degradation
Graceful degradation and service workers are borh used in ensuring the functionality of web applications, service works are used to achieve graceful degradation. Graceful degradation is one of the design strategies that we have learned about that ensures the application continues to function when parts fail or are unsupported. Service workers helps in graceful degradation as they enable resource caching and intercepting network requests. These functions are important as they allow for access to functionalities offline and enhancing performance with cached content and features. Service workers maintains a functional user experience instead of having the application fail when a network is slow or offline.
